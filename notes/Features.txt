TODO:

Remove icons for spells the Hunter doesn't have.

3.
Optionally disable the bar when not in raids/dungeons/world bosses.

4.
Scrape polymorph information from nameplates.

5.
Add sting tracker:
- a small icon that shows the currently active sting in the sting suggestion icon.


DONE:

Add a Hunter/other class detector to SharpShooter core, and conditionally disable the system:
- don't register events
- hide the bar

Don't suggest spells when Hunter doesn't have them.
