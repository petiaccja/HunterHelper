TODO:

1.
Add a Hunter/other class detector to HunterHelper core, and conditionally disable the system:
- don't register events
- hide the bar

2.
Handle cases where the Hunter doesn't have some spells
- never suggest said spells
- set size of bar icons to zero

3.
Optionally disable the bar when not in raids/dungeons/world bosses.
